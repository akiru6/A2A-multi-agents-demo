# AI Art Prompts for Open-Source Project Posters

## 1. Project: multi-agents-A2A-github-demo

**Concept:** Visualize multiple AI agents working together seamlessly on a GitHub repository, represented as interconnected digital entities interacting with code.

**AI Art Prompt:** "A futuristic poster in a dynamic, high-tech art style. Multiple interconnected glowing geometric shapes, representing AI agents, interact seamlessly around a stylized, ethereal GitHub octocat logo at the center. Flowing data streams and abstract code snippets emanate from the agents, creating a sense of intelligent collaboration. The color palette is dominated by electric blues, vibrant purples, and energetic greens, with sharp silver and white accents. Clean vector lines and neon glows enhance the futuristic aesthetic. Digital symphony of collaboration, AI swarm intelligence."

## 2. Project: ai-code-reviewer

**Concept:** An AI brain or eye meticulously analyzing lines of code, highlighting insights and improvements.

**AI Art Prompt:** "A sleek, minimalist cyberpunk poster. A central, glowing, stylized AI eye or intricate digital brain, composed of intricate circuits and light, intensely scrutinizes lines of code that flow beneath it. Subtle, electric yellow and orange highlights within the code lines indicate intelligent suggestions and improvements. The background is deep black, creating a sense of focus. The color palette features deep emerald greens, rich blacks, and sharp electric yellows/oranges for the AI's insights and glowing elements. Intelligent scrutiny, guardian of code quality."

## 3. Project: data-science-toolkit

**Concept:** A robust, well-organized toolbox overflowing with scientific instruments and digital graphs, symbolizing comprehensive data science capabilities.

**AI Art Prompt:** "A modern, clean flat design poster with isometric elements. An open, stylized toolbox stands prominently, overflowing with various symbolic data science tools: abstract charts, glowing graph icons, subtle algorithm representations, a simplified Python logo, and a Jupyter notebook icon. Abstract data waves or flowing patterns emanate from the toolbox, suggesting insights and discoveries. The color palette uses earthy blues and greens, balanced with warm ochre tones and professional greys, conveying scientific rigor and natural data exploration. The essential arsenal for data exploration, scientific discovery."

## 4. Project: web-component-library

**Concept:** Building blocks forming a cohesive, beautiful web structure, emphasizing reusability and accessibility.

**AI Art Prompt:** "A clean, geometric, minimalist poster inspired by Bauhaus design. Interlocking, translucent geometric shapes, representing web components, form a larger, elegant and cohesive abstract web structure. Subtle accessibility icons are tastefully integrated within the design, such as a high-contrast element or a symbolic hand interacting with a component. A sense of light and airy space pervades the composition. The color palette features soft, harmonious pastels like light blues, muted oranges, and gentle greys, accented by pops of brighter primary colors for key interactive elements, conveying user-friendliness and inclusivity. Digital architecture, modular harmony."
